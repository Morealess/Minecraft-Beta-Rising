-Includes Aether Enchanted Gravitite & Zanite Block textures from the built-in b1.7.3 pack (others imo are just straight up worse compared to classic_base)

(THIS IS THE ORIGINAL AND UNEDITED "Golden Days - Base - v1.10.1" by PoeticRainbow - just has added few specialized changes; compiled into 1 location as 1 pack for ease of access and simplification of distribution for use in the Beta Rising modpack! Enjoy. :D)
