-Custom Golden Days/Beta styled conversion/parity assets/fixes for mods

SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE: Also...

-Fixed mobs playing the OOF sound (restricted to the player only)

-Added oak hanging sign textures
-Added overrides for all slim skins to use Alex's original texture
-Added overrides for all wide skins to use Steve's original texture
-Rotated stairs and walls 90Â° in the inventory back to their pre-1.9 orientation
